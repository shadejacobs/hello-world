Hello, Everyone,
My name is Shade Jacobs, and I am very excited to take this course. I want to code an app to help with agriculture. I am from Central/Eastern Kentucky. I currently work in hydraulics and want to expand my knowledge. I look forward to working with everyone, growing, and learning together.
